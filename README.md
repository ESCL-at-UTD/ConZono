# Set operations and order reductions for constrained zonotopes

+ Code to compute halfspace intersections, redundancy detection and removal, inner-approximations, 
convex hull, RPI sets and Pontryagin difference using Zonotopes and Constrained Zonotopes. 

+ Applied numerical example of these methods to reachability analysis in the context of hierarchical model predictive control.

+ ## Pre-requisites 
+ Example codes uses [MATLAB R2019b or higher](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [MPT Toolbox](https://www.mpt3.org/), [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io) and [Gurobi](www.gurobi.com)

+ ## Organization Structure

+ Data Files - Contains the simulation data to plot results

+ Library Functions - Contains the custom libraries used by main code in Applied Examples

+ Applied Examples - Contains the m-files of various examples
